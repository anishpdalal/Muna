# Muna
Automatically structures text to enable active recall of facts

What is Muna?

Muna is an application that automatically generates cloze questions from user inputted text. A cloze question is a
sentence with one or more its noun phrases removed. This forces active recall of facts, which helps enforce their
memorization.

Why is it called Muna?

I learned of the word when visiting Iceland. It literally means to remember.
